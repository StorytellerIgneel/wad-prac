        Pan Island Expressway Berhad (PIEB) was established on March 13, 2013 to construct and operate the Pan Island Expressway (PIE) on Pulau Tiong. 
The company has its headquarters at Beach Tower, Myna Town and is jointly owned by the Myna Town City Council (MTCC) and M Construction Pte Ltd.
PIEB has been awarded the concession to construct and operate the PIE on September 11, 2013. Construction has begun on February 17, 2014 and is scheduled to be completed in August 2016. Upon the completion and opening of the PIE, toll collection will begin after a two-month toll- free access period. Toll collection is imposed for 30 years or when the construction cost has been fully recovered, whichever occurs first.
