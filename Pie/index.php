            Pan Island Expressway Berhad (PIEB) was established on March 13, 2013 to construct and operate the Pan Island Expressway (PIE) on Pulau Tiong. The PIE is a 25km open-toll expressway that will traverse from north to south along the eastern coast of the island and forms part of the Pulau Tiong Ring Road (PTRR). The expressway will also feature a 5km tunnel that will run underneath the central business district of Myna Town.
